# Unveiling Azure Landing Zone

An Azure Landing Zone lays down the foundation for Azure environment by adhering to **a set of design principles spanning eight critical areas**. It segregates resources into platform and application landing zones, each facilitated by Azure subscriptions. This structure not only accommodates diverse application portfolios but also paves the way for migration, modernization, and innovation at scale.

# Landing Zone Archetypes: The Blueprint of Azure Landing Zone

The Landing Zone Archetype in Azure is a blueprint ensuring that a Landing Zone meets the stipulated environment and compliance requirements. Key elements like [Azure Policy assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview), [Role-based Access Control (RBAC) assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview#azure-policy-and-azure-rbac), and centrally managed resources like networking are pivotal to these archetypes.

Management groups within the resource hierarchy play a vital role, contributing to the final archetype output due to Azure’s policy inheritance mechanism. While a management group isn’t a landing zone archetype, it forms a part of the framework used to implement each archetype in your Azure environment.

# Reference Implementations: Your Quick Start to Azure Landing Zone

Azure provides several reference implementations such as Azure landing zone with [Azure Virtual WAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about), [traditional hub and spoke](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?tabs=cli), [foundation](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/wingtip/README.md), and a specific construct for [small enterprises](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/wingtip/README.md). These implementations, grounded in best practices from Microsoft’s engagements with customers and partners, act as a quick start to deploying Azure Landing Zone.

# Tailoring Azure Landing Zone: A Custom Fit

Not all organizations can leverage a reference implementation as intended due to unique use cases. This is where the significance of tailoring comes into play. Tailoring allows organizations to modify or create new archetypes based on their specific needs and requirements, ensuring a custom fit.

When tailoring, it’s crucial to understand the existing hierarchy and visualize the areas suggested for customization. The tailoring process can occur in two primary segments of the hierarchy, under the Landing Zones and Platform management groups, for **application** and **platform** landing zone archetypes respectively.

# Tailoring Application Landing Zone Archetypes:

Tailoring Application Landing Zone (ALZ) archetypes requires a systematic approach to accommodate specific application workloads and organizational needs while ensuring operational **efficiency**, **security**, and **compliance**.

**Requirements Gathering:**
    Understand the specific needs and requirements of the applications to be hosted.
    Collect input from stakeholders, such as developers, operations teams, and compliance officers.

    Stay updated on evolving best practices and emerging technologies that could enhance the ALZ framework.

# Tailoring Platform Landing Zone Archetypes:

Tailoring Platform Landing Zone (PLZ) archetypes is essential for creating a standardized, yet flexible environment for hosting and managing various platforms efficiently and securely.

**Requirements Gathering:**
    Understand the specific needs and requirements of the platforms to be hosted.
    Engage with stakeholders like platform owners, developers, operations teams, and compliance officers to collect necessary input and expectations.

**Designing the Hierarchy:**
    Create a structured hierarchy within the Platform Landing Zones management group to accommodate the new archetypes.
    Ensure the design is scalable and can cater to different platform types and future requirements.

**Policy Inheritance and Configuration:**
    Define the core policies and configurations that should be inherited by the new management group under the Platform Landing Zones.
    Establish foundational policies ensuring a consistent level of security, compliance, and operational standards across all PLZs.

**Custom Policy Development:**
    Identify any gaps between the inherited policies and the specific requirements of the new archetypes.
    Develop custom policies to address these gaps, ensuring alignment with organizational standards and best practices.

**Implementation:**
    Implement the new hierarchy and policies in a staging or development environment to validate the setup.
    Once validated, deploy the setup in the production environment.

**Monitoring and Auditing:**
    Set up robust monitoring and auditing mechanisms to ensure ongoing adherence to policies and to proactively identify potential issues.
    Establish a regular review and auditing process to ensure compliance and operational efficiency.

**Documentation and Training:**
    Document the new PLZ archetype, detailing its structure, policies, and procedures.
    Train the relevant teams on how to work within this new framework, ensuring smooth operations and adherence to policies.

**Continuous Improvement:**
    Regularly review the effectiveness of the PLZ archetypes and gather feedback from stakeholders for continuous improvement.
    Stay updated on evolving best practices, emerging technologies, and organizational needs to enhance the PLZ framework accordingly.

### Points to Ponder :

By following this structured approach, organizations can tailor PLZ archetypes to meet their specific needs, ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient environment for hosting and managing platforms. This methodology also ensures that the process is repeatable and adaptable to accommodate varying requirements and scenarios in the future.

> But tailoring isn’t mandatory and should be approached only when truly needed. It's advisable not to recreate organizational hierarchy in archetypes and to avoid exceeding a hierarchy depth of four layers to evade complexity.
