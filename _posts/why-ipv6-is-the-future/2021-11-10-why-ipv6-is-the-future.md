A quick walkthrough...

𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟰:
- Uses 32-bit addresses
- Lack of built-in security features
- Limited number of unique addresses
- Challenges with mobile and roaming devices

𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲:
- Uses 128-bit addresses
- Abundant address space
- Improved network performance 
- Auto Configuration Capabilities
- Faster and more efficient routing
- NAT free end-to-end communication 
- Better quality of service for real-time apps
