# The Early Days

My entry into the tech world started in childhood with an inherent curiosity about computers. After following a standard academic path, I began my professional journey in the banking industry, working with mainframe systems, before gradually transitioning to more contemporary technologies.

# The Cloud Computing: A Game Changer

Discovering the Cloud was a pivotal moment in my career. The ability to scale resources on demand, coupled with a robust suite of tools, made me realise this was the future I wanted to be part of.

Countless hours were (and are still) dedicated on studying, experimenting, and implementing various services and features.

# The Present and Beyond

Today, I bring expertise to help businesses harness the power of the Cloud to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and spark innovation. Seeing the tangible impact of my work is what motivates me every day.

This space is my way of giving back—a place to share insights, experiences, and learnings on various technological topics. It’s also a tribute to the incredible people who have supported and inspired me along the way. Their belief in me has helped me step out of the ordinary and strive for better. Rather than listing names and risking omissions, I hope they’ll recognize themselves in these words.

As I move forward, I aim to continue sharing knowledge that’s not only useful but also a small way of paying forward the wisdom and kindness I’ve received.
