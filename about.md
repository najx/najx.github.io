# The Early Days

My journey into the world of technology began in my childhood. Captivated by computers, I knew early on that I wanted to pursue a career in Information Technology.

I then followed a conventional educational path before entering the industry, starting in the banking sector with mainframes before gradually opening myself to newer areas.

# The Cloud Computing: A Game Changer

Discovering the Cloud was a pivotal moment in my career. The ability to scale resources on demand, coupled with a robust suite of tools, made me realise this was the future I wanted to be part of.

Countless hours were (and are still) dedicated on studying, experimenting, and implementing various services and features.

# The Present and Beyond

Today, I bring expertise to help businesses leverage the power of the Cloud to streamline their processes, increase efficiency, and drive innovation. The joy of seeing the impact of my work makes it all worthwhile.

Moving forward, I hope to humbly share experiences, learnings, and insights about some technologic areas with you through this personal space of the world wide (wild) web. If you have any specific topics youâ€™d like to share me, feel free to leave a message or reach me directly on LinkedIn.

Thank you for reading and joining me on this exciting journey. Stay tuned!
