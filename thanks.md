This little corner is dedicated to the amazing people I have met who believed in me and helped me step out of the ordinary to become great.

For fear of forgetting some or of being overly comprehensive, I'd rather let them recognize themselves.

Hopefully the knowledge that I got from them can be useful, and become a charity for them.

Thank you.
